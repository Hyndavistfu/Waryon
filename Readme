Waryon – The Watchful Guardian
AI That Watches, Listens, and Acts. Fully On-Premises for Maximum Privacy and Real-Time Protection.

🔍 Overview
Waryon is an AI-powered personal safety system designed to provide proactive, intelligent protection in real-time. Built for vulnerable individuals such as women, the elderly, and those in high-risk situations, Waryon listens for distress cues and visually analyzes surroundings to detect threats—responding instantly with alerts, deterrents, and guidance.

Unlike traditional safety tools, Waryon runs fully on-device, ensuring maximum privacy, low latency, and uninterrupted protection, even without internet connectivity.

🚨 Key Features
Real-Time Threat Detection
Monitors both audio and visual input to detect signs of distress, physical danger, or unusual activity.

Instant Autonomous Response
Triggers alarms, records evidence, and sends alerts when suspicious or harmful behavior is detected.

Multi-Modal Sensing
Uses combined visual and auditory cues for intelligent scene understanding and risk assessment.

Offline & Private
Designed for full offline operation. No data is sent to the cloud—your safety stays with you.

Accessible for All
Designed with accessibility in mind to assist a broad range of users in vulnerable contexts.

💡 Why Waryon?
Every day, millions face risks in public and private spaces—with no timely way to ask for help. Waryon aims to fill this gap by:
