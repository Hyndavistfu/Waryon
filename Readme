## 🛡️ About Waryon

**Waryon** is a privacy-first, real-time AI safety companion built to detect violence, distress, or abuse through **audio and visual cues** — and act immediately.

Designed especially for vulnerable individuals (women, elders, children, or anyone at risk), Waryon simulates intelligent **on-premises alerting** without requiring an internet connection, cloud APIs, or external dependencies.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **👁️ Video Surveillance with Violence Detection**  
  Processes video input to detect violent behavior or threats using fine-tuned models.

- **🎤 Audio-Based Distress Detection**  
  Listens for screams, shouting, or distress tones even if video feed is blocked.

- **⚡ Immediate Alerts**  
  Once a threat is detected, Waryon raises a local alert or performs a custom action (e.g., log, sound, light, SMS trigger if extended).

- **🔐 Fully On-Premises**  
  No internet, no cloud dependency — all processing is done locally using **Gemma 3n** LLMs and lightweight perception models.

- **🧠 Smart Fusion**  
  Combines sound and vision for more accurate decisions — reducing false positives.

## 🚨 Why Waryon?

> “Because safety shouldn’t come at the cost of privacy.”

In many environments, surveillance and safety tools either:
- invade personal privacy via cloud uploads,
- fail to act in real-time, or
- are biased toward specific users or genders.

Waryon ensures that **any person under threat — regardless of gender, age, or context —** receives fast, unbiased, offline protection.
